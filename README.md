I'm a data analyst at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)), supporting the Long Term Ecological Research ([LTER](https://lternet.edu/)) Network synthesis working groups. Visit the [SciComp team's homepage](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/) to learn more about how we help LTER working groups! In short, I help develop reproducible workflows to wrangle, harmonize, analyze, and visualize ecological datasets. I'm interested in learning about the best practices for reproducible, open science. In my spare time, I like to watch birds 🐦
