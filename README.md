I'm a data scientist for the [Malone Disturbance Ecology Lab](https://www.malonelab.org/) at Yale School of the Environment. In short, I help develop reproducible workflows to wrangle, harmonize, analyze, and visualize ecological datasets. I'm interested in learning about the best practices for reproducible, open science. In my spare time, I like to watch birds 🐦
